My website showcases the evolution of my coding journey.

### Projects

---

Through my early projects I learned the fundamentals of React including state management and hooks. With each new project I implemented new elements such as error handling with RegEx, form handling, and Fetch API.

All of these skills I developed are showcased in my Recipe Search project. This application allows users to click on a cusine type and view recipes from the selected category. The user can then save recipe cards to the Favorites page as well as add cards to the Make Recipe page. On this page users can create a grocery list as well as write notes about each recipe.

The Hostel Search project demonstrates my frontend and backend skills. In this application users submit the country of their choice and then select from a list of cities. Once a city is selected a series of graphs are rendered. These graphs display hostel ranks based on certain categories such as atmosphere and cleanliness. This project utilizes Python, JavaScript, React, and Flask Jupyter Notebook.
